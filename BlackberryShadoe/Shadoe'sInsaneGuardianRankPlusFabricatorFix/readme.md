##### In the past, using a hotfix (or trainer) we were able to push to the max how much xp you can get per enemy killed.
##### However, even with that being used, it would still take about 4-6 minutes to boost someone's Guardian Rank. Well...
##### Going thru official gbx hotfixes in the "point-in-time" repo that Apocolyptech set up, I found a line of code that made
##### edits to how Guardian Rank is being calculated. I started messing with the formula and after a few tries, have 
##### managed to successfully change it. Here, instead of just increasing the xp gains to max, the amount of xp needed for 
##### every Guardian Rank level was massively reduced. Now, it take ONE enemy killed to gain about 2500 levels, depending
##### on initial rank level (as the amount of xp needed, the higher the GR, still grows, just at a lot slower rate) Of course,
##### this is useless to those on PC that can just edit their rank with a save editor. However, there are those that help those
##### that are on consoles and this will be a huge time saver. I'm also including my slight edits to the eridium/keys fabricator
##### hotfix, where the fire rate was reduced for keys a little bit (for stability on old-gen consoles) but the value of each was 
##### massively increased. Here, 10 shots from "Eridium/Cash" gives almost 100 mil and about a billion cash, and 10 shots
##### from "Keyzzz" gives about 100 million diamond/ALL vault card keys. Sharing this utility for those that help.
